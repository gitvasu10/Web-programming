# Web-programming
This repository contains the HTML and CSS code files. 
Currently, there is not much into this repo as it is just a beginner's one only.
More files would be added with the passing time, with the increase in amount of practice.
Till now, two folders have been created under the names of CSS_FILES and Intro-to-HTML and all the corresponding files are in the respective folders.
The gradual can be monitored by looking at the way the number of files and their contents.
Finally,a minor project will be uploaded into it...
